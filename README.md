# hey guys
for PLNU Software Engineering puzzle project. lets get it

## install git
see if you dont already have it: `git --version`

Follow the [steps](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to get it installed

make sure its installed with `git --version`

## install eclipse for java
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

## get the project
create a git folder in your home directory

`mkdir git && cd git`

clone this project

`git clone https://github.com/MeTwo99/puzzle.git`

## add project to eclipse
open eclipse and import the Puzzle project from your freshly-cloned local git repository

you can use these [steps](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse373/18au/resources/eclipse-import-from-git-guide.html) but instead of adding a project from URI, use from local repo. There, you should find the REPO and in the repo there is a PROJECT. import the Puzzle project. It should now pop up as a project in your package explorer.
